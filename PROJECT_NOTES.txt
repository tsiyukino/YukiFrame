YUKI-FRAME v2.0 - RESTRUCTURED PROJECT
======================================

MAJOR CHANGES FROM v1.0
-----------------------

1. INTEGRATED CONTROL SYSTEM
   - Control module is now part of framework core
   - No separate control_module.exe needed
   - Direct API access (no IPC overhead)
   - File: src/core/control.c

2. INTEGRATED LOGGING SYSTEM
   - Enhanced logging built into framework
   - Multiple log levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
   - File: src/core/logger.c

3. INTEGRATED DEBUG SYSTEM
   - Debug mode enabled with -d flag
   - Event tracing and tool tracking
   - State dumping capabilities
   - File: src/core/debug.c

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
-------------------

1. IMPLEMENT STUB FILES
   The following files are stubs and need full implementation:
   
   - src/core/logger.c       (logging implementation)
   - src/core/event.c        (event bus implementation)
   - src/core/tool.c         (tool registry and management)
   - src/core/config.c       (configuration parser)
   - src/core/platform_linux.c   (Linux platform code)
   - src/core/platform_windows.c (Windows platform code)
   
   You can copy implementations from the original Yuki-Frame source
   or implement from scratch using the header files as a guide.

2. CONFIGURATION CHANGES
   Remove these from your config:
   
   [tool:control]           ← DELETE THIS
   [tool:config_sender]     ← DELETE THIS
   
   These are now built-in!

3. BUILD AND TEST
   
   Linux:
   $ ./build.sh
   $ ./build/yuki-frame -c yuki-frame.conf -d
   
   Windows:
   > build.bat
   > build\Release\yuki-frame.exe -c yuki-frame.conf -d

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------

The stub files marked above need implementation. You have two options:

Option 1: Copy from Original Source
   If you have the original Yuki-Frame source code, copy the
   implementations from there. The interfaces (headers) are
   compatible.

Option 2: Implement from Scratch
   Use the header files as your API contract. Implement each
   function according to its declaration and documentation.

Option 3: Use This as a Template
   This restructured version serves as a blueprint. The main.c,
   control.c, and debug.c files show how to integrate everything.
   Use these as examples for the other components.

MIGRATION FROM v1.0
-------------------

1. Remove control module configuration
2. Remove config_sender configuration
3. Add core options (optional):
   [core]
   enable_debug = no
   log_level = INFO

4. Rebuild and test

API CHANGES
-----------

Old (v1.0):
   - Send events to control module
   - Wait for responses

New (v2.0):
   - Direct function calls
   - Immediate responses
   - No IPC latency

Example:
   Old: print("START_TOOL|control|my_tool")
   New: control_start_tool("my_tool")

BENEFITS
--------

✅ Simpler architecture (no separate control process)
✅ Faster operations (no IPC overhead)
✅ More reliable (fewer failure points)
✅ Easier debugging (unified logging)
✅ Better performance (direct function calls)

NEXT STEPS
----------

1. Review the architecture: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
2. Implement stub files or copy from original source
3. Build and test
4. Deploy your restructured framework
5. Enjoy the simplified architecture!

SUPPORT
-------

- All header files are complete
- Main.c, control.c, debug.c are complete
- Example tools are working
- Build system is ready
- Documentation is comprehensive

You just need to implement the stub source files!

Good luck! 🚀
